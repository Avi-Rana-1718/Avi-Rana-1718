Though I might not have applied all the concepts perfect but I still learned a lot. I'll explain them one-by-one. <br/><br/> <h3 class='text-lg underline'>Frames per seconds/FPS</h3> <p> FPS or frames per seconds is decided by how much time it takes for the computer to compute & render everything for the frame. If it takes 0.1 seconds on average, then your game will have 10fps. <br/><br/> Another important concept related the fps is delta time which helps with keeping the game speed and other things consistent when fps changes/drops. I haven't study this yet. </p> <br /> <h3 class='text-lg underline'>ECS/Entity-Components-Systems</h3> <p> ECS is a <u>software architectural pattern</u> used in most video games. In ECS, we separate the entities, components & systems. What are these, you may ask? <br/><br/> Entities are anything can be a seen, interacted or any object that can respond to player input or other entities. <br /><br/> Components are collection of specific type of data about entities. For example: CTransform, this component stores information about an entity's X & Y position and it's X & Y speed. <br /><br/> Systems on the other hand act on the information stored within said components and manipulate them. <br /><br/> <h3 class='text-lg underline'>Frames per seconds/FPS</h3> </p>"

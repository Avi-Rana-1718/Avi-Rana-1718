        <h2>C</h2>
        <small>By Avi Rana</small>

        <p>
            C is a programming language by <i>Dennis Ritchie</i> in 1972. It became popular because it was considered <b>easy</b> & <b>simple</b>. <u>C++</u>, <u>C#</u> & <u>Java</u> are superset of C.
            It is a major part of operating systems like Windows, UNIX, Linux & Android. Also device drivers, video games and microprocessors are written exclusively in C. 
            These program are required to be fast and occupy the least amount of memory, hence they are also written in C. The standard version of C is <mark>C99</mark>.
        </p>

        <p>
            A C program consists of algorithms and statements.

            <h4>Programs</h4>
            A program is a collection of algorithms or implementation of one or more algorithms. A program is written in a computer language(or low level language) which the machine turns into <u>Machine Code</u> also known as Binary Code or Object Code (index.obj).
        
            <h4>Algorithms</h4>
            An algorithms is a combination of <u>instructions</u> that must be excecuted in a particular sequence. It can be expressed in a normal human understandable way. For example, baking a cake, finding compound interest or an algorithm for turning on a fan switch
            <ul>
                <li>Step 1 - Get Up</li>
                <li>Step 2 - Walk upto the switch board</li>
                <li>Step 3 - Determine which switch turns the fan on</li>
                <li>Step 4 - Press the switch</li>
            </ul>

            In short, an algorithm can de defined as a systematic & logical approach for solving a problem.

            <h4>Statements</h4>
            A C program consists of a number of steps, these steps are known as Statements. They are fragments of the C program that are executed in sequence. It is a followed by a semicolon at the end.

            <h3><u>Getting Started With C</u></h3>
            To make a C program, we must first write it's source code.

            <br><br>
            Source Code is a fundamental part of a program. It is usually created by a programmer. It can be understood by humans. This source code is converted into object code which essentailly makes
             up the program. It undergoes the following process to finally became the object code:
             <ul>
                <li>
                    Source code
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pre processor
                </li>
                <li>
                    Expanded Code - Include Header Files
                </li>
                <li>
                    Compiler
                </li>
                <li>
                    Assembly Code
                </li>
                <li>
                    Assembler
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Machine Code/Object Code
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Linker/Loader
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            test.exe
                        </li>
             </ul>

             <h4>Alphabets, Digits & Special Symbols</h4>
             All allowed characthers in C
             <table border="1">
                <tr>
                    <th>Alphabets</th>
                    <td>A, B, ............, Y, Z</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>
                        Digits
                    </th>
                    <td>
                        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

                <tr>

                        Special Symbols

                        ~ ' ! @ # ^ & * () _ - + = | \ {} [] : ;" ` , . ? $
                    </td>
                </tr>
             </table>

             <h4>Keywords</h4>
             Keywords or reserved are pre defined words which are known by the compiler. These words are reserved and can not be used for any other purpose.

            <h4><i>Example</i></h4>
            A basic example of a C program is
            <br><br>
<code>
    #include < stdio.h ><br>
    <br>
    int main() {       <br>
printf("Hello World!");<br>
        return 0;      <br>
    }
</code>
